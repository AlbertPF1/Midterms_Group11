# CEILING Function
The **CEILING** function is used to round a number *"up"* to the nearest multiple of a specified significance or increment. It's a mathematical function that can be particularly useful when you want to ensure that a value is always rounded up to the nearest desired level or step.

- *Syntax:* =CEILING(number, significance)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value that you want to round up. 

    - *"significance"*: This is the multiple to which you want to round the number. The function rounds the "number" up to the nearest value that is a multiple of the "significance." 

Here's how the CEILING function works:

1. It takes the "number" and divides it by the "significance."
2. It then rounds up to the nearest integer.
3. Finally, it multiplies the rounded-up integer by the "significance" to give you the rounded-up result.

# FLOOR Function
The **FLOOR** function is used to round a number *"down"* to the nearest multiple of a specified significance or increment. It's a mathematical function that can be particularly useful when you want to ensure that a value is always rounded up to the nearest desired level or step.

- *Syntax:* =FLOOR(number, significance)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value that you want to round up. 

    - *"significance"*: This is the multiple to which you want to round the number. The function rounds the "number" down to the nearest value that is a multiple of the "significance." 

Here's how the FLOOR function works:

1. It takes the "number" and divides it by the "significance."
2. It then rounds down to the nearest integer.
3. Finally, it multiplies the rounded-down integer by the "significance" to give you the rounded-down result.

# ROUND Function
The **ROUND** function is used to round a number to a specified number of decimal places. The ROUND function helps you control the precision of numerical values in your spreadsheets.
- *Syntax:* =ROUND(number, num_digits)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value you want to round.

    - *"num_digits    "*: This is the number of decimal places to which you want to round the number.

Here's a breakdown of how the ROUND function works:

1. "number": This is the value you want to round. It can be a cell reference, a constant, or a formula that results in a numeric value.
2. "num_digits": This argument specifies the number of decimal places to which you want to round the number. It can be a positive or negative integer.
    - If num_digits is a positive integer, the function rounds the number to that many decimal places. For example, if num_digits is 2, the function will round to two decimal places.

    - If num_digits is zero, the function rounds to the nearest whole number.

    - If num_digits is a negative integer, the function rounds to the left of the decimal point. For example, if num_digits is -1, the function rounds to the nearest ten, making the number end in zero.
