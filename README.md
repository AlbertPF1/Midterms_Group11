# Math Functions
## CEILING Function
The **CEILING** function is used to round a number *"up"* to the nearest multiple of a specified significance or increment. It's a mathematical function that can be particularly useful when you want to ensure that a value is always rounded up to the nearest desired level or step.

- *Syntax:* =CEILING(number, significance)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value that you want to round up. 

    - *"significance"*: This is the multiple to which you want to round the number. The function rounds the "number" up to the nearest value that is a multiple of the "significance." 

Here's how the CEILING function works:

1. It takes the "number" and divides it by the "significance."
2. It then rounds up to the nearest integer.
3. Finally, it multiplies the rounded-up integer by the "significance" to give you the rounded-up result.

## FLOOR Function
The **FLOOR** function is used to round a number *"down"* to the nearest multiple of a specified significance or increment. It's a mathematical function that can be particularly useful when you want to ensure that a value is always rounded up to the nearest desired level or step.

- *Syntax:* =FLOOR(number, significance)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value that you want to round up. 

    - *"significance"*: This is the multiple to which you want to round the number. The function rounds the "number" down to the nearest value that is a multiple of the "significance." 

Here's how the FLOOR function works:

1. It takes the "number" and divides it by the "significance."
2. It then rounds down to the nearest integer.
3. Finally, it multiplies the rounded-down integer by the "significance" to give you the rounded-down result.

## EVEN Function
The **EVEN** function is used to round a number up to the nearest even integer. 
- *Syntax:* =EVEN(number)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value you want to round up to the nearest even integer.

The EVEN function takes a single argument, which is the number you want to round up to the nearest even integer. When you use the EVEN function, it rounds the number up to the next even integer. If the number is already an even integer, it remains unchanged.

</p>


## ROUND Function
The **ROUND** function is used to round a number to a specified number of decimal places. The ROUND function helps you control the precision of numerical values in your spreadsheets.
- *Syntax:* =ROUND(number, num_digits)

    - *"number"*: This is the numeric value you want to round.

    - *"num_digits    "*: This is the number of decimal places to which you want to round the number.

Here's a breakdown of how the ROUND function works:

1. "number": This is the value you want to round. It can be a cell reference, a constant, or a formula that results in a numeric value.
2. "num_digits": This argument specifies the number of decimal places to which you want to round the number. It can be a positive or negative integer.
    - If num_digits is a positive integer, the function rounds the number to that many decimal places. For example, if num_digits is 2, the function will round to two decimal places.

    - If num_digits is zero, the function rounds to the nearest whole number.

    - If num_digits is a negative integer, the function rounds to the left of the decimal point. For example, if num_digits is -1, the function rounds to the nearest ten, making the number end in zero.

# Date and Time Functions

## NOW AND TODAY FUNCTION
The **"NOW" and "TODAY"** function are used to display the current date and time or just the current date, respectively. These functions are useful when you need to insert the current date and time into a cell or use them in calculations.

- *Syntax:* =NOW() , =TODAY()

The "NOW" function returns the current date and time. The "TODAY" function, on the other hand, returns only the current date (without the time). 

Like the NOW function, the TODAY function doesn't require any arguments. It retrieves the current date from your computer's system clock and displays it in the cell.

The TODAY function is often used to track dates or for date-related calculations where you don't need the time component.

Both the NOW and TODAY functions can be particularly useful in various scenarios, including record-keeping, project management, and data analysis, where tracking or referencing the current date and time is essential.

## WEEKNUM FUNCTION
The **WEEKNUM** function is used to determine the week number for a specified date. The WEEKNUM function returns the week number within the year for a given date.

- *Syntax:* =WEEKNUM(date, [return_type])

    - *"date"*: This is the date for which you want to determine the week number. You can enter the date as a cell reference, a date value, or a formula that results in a date.

    - *"[return_type]"*(optional): This argument specifies the method for determining the week number, and it is an optional argument. If you omit it, Excel assumes a default value of 1.

      - If you omit [return_type] or set it to 1, the WEEKNUM function will return week numbers according to the system's default. The week containing January 1 is considered week 1.
         
      - If you set [return_type] to 2, the WEEKNUM function will return week numbers according to ISO standards. In this system, the first week of the year is the one that contains the first Thursday.

The WEEKNUM function is useful in various business and project management scenarios where you need to track tasks, deadlines, or events by week number. It allows you to quickly categorize and organize data based on the week in the year.
